# Contributing to Cloudflare Sandbox SDK

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Cloudflare Sandbox SDK! This guide will help you get started with development.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Docker (for container development)
- Bun (install from https://bun.sh)
- A Cloudflare account (for testing in production)

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/sandbox-sdk
   cd sandbox-sdk
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install container dependencies**

   The container source has its own dependencies that need to be installed for TypeScript checking:
   ```bash
   cd packages/sandbox/container_src && bun install && cd -
   ```

   > **Note**: This step is required for TypeScript to properly check the container source files. Without it, you'll see errors about missing modules like `@jupyterlab/services` and `uuid`.

4. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Run type checking and linting**
   ```bash
   npm run check
   ```

### Project Structure

This is a Turborepo monorepo with multiple packages:

```
sandbox-sdk/
├── packages/
│   ├── sandbox/             # Main SDK package (@cloudflare/sandbox)
│   │   ├── src/             # Client SDK + Durable Object
│   │   ├── container_src/   # Container runtime code (uses Bun)
│   │   └── Dockerfile       # Container image definition
│   ├── sandbox-container/   # Container runtime package (@repo/sandbox-container)
│   └── shared/              # Shared TypeScript types (@repo/shared)
├── tooling/
│   ├── typescript-config/   # Shared TypeScript configurations
│   └── vitest-config/       # Shared Vitest configurations
├── examples/
│   ├── basic/               # Basic usage example
│   └── code-interpreter/    # Code interpreter example
└── package.json             # Workspace configuration
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Making Changes**
   - SDK code is in `packages/sandbox/src/`
   - Container runtime code is in `packages/sandbox/container_src/`
   - Shared types are in `packages/shared/src/`
   - Example code is in `examples/`

2. **Running Tests**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests (Turborepo handles parallelization)
   npm test

   # Run tests for specific package
   npm test -w @cloudflare/sandbox

   # Run specific test suites
   npm run test:unit           # Fast unit tests
   npm run test:integration    # Integration tests
   ```

3. **Type Checking**
   ```bash
   # Check all packages
   npm run typecheck

   # Check specific package
   npm run typecheck -w @cloudflare/sandbox
   ```

4. **Linting**
   ```bash
   # Lint and type check all packages
   npm run check

   # Auto-fix linting issues
   npm run fix
   ```

5. **Building**
   ```bash
   # Build all packages (Turborepo handles dependencies)
   npm run build

   # Build specific package
   npm run build -w @cloudflare/sandbox

   # Second build should be nearly instant (FULL TURBO)
   npm run build  # ~43ms with cache hit
   ```

### Testing Locally

To test the SDK locally with the example (ensure you've completed the development setup):

1. **Navigate to the example directory**
   ```bash
   cd examples/basic
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:8787`)

### Container Development

The container source (`container_src/`) uses Bun as its runtime and has separate dependencies:

- Uses `bun.lock` for dependency management
- Requires `bun install` for installing dependencies
- Dependencies are installed inside Docker during build, but also needed locally for TypeScript

### Common Issues

1. **TypeScript errors about missing modules**
   - Make sure you've run `cd packages/sandbox/container_src && bun install`
   - This installs the container dependencies needed for type checking

2. **Port exposure errors in local development**
   - Ensure your Dockerfile includes `EXPOSE` directives for required ports
   - See the README for details on local development port requirements

3. **Build failures**
   - Run `npm run clean` to clear build artifacts
   - Ensure Docker is running for container builds

### Submitting Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clear, concise commit messages
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Run all checks**
   ```bash
   npm run check
   npm test
   ```

4. **Submit a pull request**
   - Provide a clear description of your changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Ensure all CI checks pass

### Code Style

- We use TypeScript for all code
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by Biome)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
