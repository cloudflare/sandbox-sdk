# PR Title & Description

**feat: comprehensive testing infrastructure and client architecture improvements**

## Summary

This PR establishes a complete testing suite for the Cloudflare Sandbox SDK and implements significant architectural improvements across multiple layers.

## Key Improvements

**Testing Infrastructure (476 comprehensive tests)**
- **Unit Tests**: Complete modular client testing with enhanced error handling validation  
- **Integration Tests**: Client-container communication with Workers runtime compatibility
- **Container Tests**: Real container HTTP endpoint testing with dynamic build ID support
- **E2E Tests**: Full development workflows including git operations and streaming

**Client Architecture Refactor**
- Refactored monolithic HttpClient into domain-specific clients (Command, File, Process, Port, Git, Utility)
- Enhanced error handling system with rich error classes and proper HTTP status mapping
- Improved session management and cross-client coordination

**Security & Bug Fixes**
- Fixed critical port access control vulnerability - unexposed ports now properly protected with token validation
- Enhanced preview URL security with mandatory cryptographic tokens
- Fixed IPv6 localhost pattern detection and POST request body streaming issues

**CI/CD Optimization**
- Streamlined GitHub Actions workflows with appropriate test coverage per environment
- Environment-aware logging for clean CI output
- Efficient test script organization

## Technical Achievements

- **Container Testing Breakthrough**: Solved "impossible" Build ID problem in `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`
- **Complete Error System**: 25+ specific error types with container-to-client error mapping
- **Professional SDK Structure**: Follows AWS/Google Cloud patterns with organized domain clients
- **100% Backward Compatibility**: All existing code continues working unchanged

## Files Modified
