# HttpClient Refactoring Plan

## Problem Analysis
The current HttpClient class has 1000+ lines with 15+ methods handling multiple domains (commands, files, processes, ports, git), making it difficult to test effectively and maintain.

## Issues Identified
1. **Violation of Single Responsibility Principle**: Handles commands, files, processes, ports, git operations in single class
2. **Testing Challenges**: 15+ methods create massive test surface with repetitive mocking
3. **Code Maintainability**: 1000+ lines, mixed concerns, repeated patterns
4. **Low Value Tests**: Most tests would just verify HTTP structure, not business logic

## Proposed Solution: Domain-Specific Client Architecture

### 1. Create Base HTTP Client ‚è≥
- Extract common HTTP logic (`doFetch`, error handling, response processing)
- Provide shared infrastructure for all domain clients
- Handle authentication, logging, and common patterns

**Files to create:**
- `src/clients/base-http-client.ts` - Abstract base with common HTTP patterns
- `src/clients/types.ts` - Shared client interfaces and types

### 2. Split into Domain Clients ‚è≥

#### CommandClient ‚è≥
- **Methods**: `execute()`, `executeStream()`
- **File**: `src/clients/command-client.ts`
- **Focus**: Command execution with streaming support

#### FileClient ‚è≥  
- **Methods**: `writeFile()`, `readFile()`, `deleteFile()`, `moveFile()`, `renameFile()`, `mkdir()`
- **File**: `src/clients/file-client.ts`
- **Focus**: File system operations

#### ProcessClient ‚è≥
- **Methods**: `startProcess()`, `listProcesses()`, `getProcess()`, `killProcess()`, `killAllProcesses()`, `getProcessLogs()`, `streamProcessLogs()`
- **File**: `src/clients/process-client.ts`
- **Focus**: Background process management

#### PortClient ‚è≥
- **Methods**: `exposePort()`, `unexposePort()`, `getExposedPorts()`
- **File**: `src/clients/port-client.ts`
- **Focus**: Port management and preview URLs

#### GitClient ‚è≥
- **Methods**: `gitCheckout()`
- **File**: `src/clients/git-client.ts`
- **Focus**: Git repository operations

#### UtilityClient ‚è≥
- **Methods**: `ping()`, `getCommands()`
- **File**: `src/clients/utility-client.ts`
- **Focus**: Health checks and metadata

### 3. Create Composed Main Client ‚è≥
- **SandboxClient** with properties: `commands`, `files`, `processes`, `ports`, `git`, `utils`
- **File**: `src/clients/sandbox-client.ts`
- Clear, organized API: `client.files.writeFile()` instead of `client.writeFile()`

### 4. Maintain Backward Compatibility ‚è≥
- **HttpClient Facade**: Keep existing HttpClient as wrapper around SandboxClient
- **File**: Update `src/client.ts` to use SandboxClient internally
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing method calls continue to work

### 5. Update Exports ‚è≥
- **File**: Update `src/index.ts` to export new clients
- Export both new SandboxClient and legacy HttpClient
- Allow users to gradually migrate to new API

## Benefits
- **Testable**: Each client has 2-5 focused methods instead of 15+
- **Maintainable**: Single responsibility per client
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new domains without bloating existing clients
- **Professional**: Follows established SDK patterns (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.)
- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes for existing users

## Testing Strategy After Refactor
- **BaseHttpClient**: Unit test HTTP patterns, error handling, response processing
- **Domain Clients**: Unit test 2-5 methods each with focused scenarios
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows with container
- **Much More Manageable**: ~30 focused tests vs 15+ complex tests

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation ‚è≥
1. Create BaseHttpClient with common HTTP logic
2. Create shared types and interfaces
3. Test BaseHttpClient thoroughly

### Phase 2: Domain Clients ‚è≥
1. Implement CommandClient (highest priority - most used)
2. Implement FileClient (second priority - file operations)
3. Implement ProcessClient (background processes)
4. Implement PortClient (port management)
5. Implement GitClient (repository operations)
6. Implement UtilityClient (health/metadata)

### Phase 3: Integration ‚è≥
1. Create SandboxClient as composition of domain clients
2. Update HttpClient to use SandboxClient internally (facade pattern)
3. Update exports and maintain backward compatibility
4. Update documentation and examples

### Phase 4: Testing ‚è≥
1. Comprehensive unit tests for each domain client
2. Integration tests for complete workflows
3. Backward compatibility tests
4. Performance validation

## Migration Path for Users

### Current Usage:
```typescript
const client = new HttpClient(options);
await client.writeFile('/test.txt', 'content');
await client.execute('ls -la');
await client.startProcess('npm start');
```

### New Usage (Optional):
```typescript
const client = new SandboxClient(options);
await client.files.writeFile('/test.txt', 'content');
await client.commands.execute('ls -la');  
await client.processes.startProcess('npm start');
```

### Backward Compatibility:
```typescript
// This continues to work unchanged
const client = new HttpClient(options);
await client.writeFile('/test.txt', 'content');
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All domain clients implemented with focused responsibilities
- [ ] 100% backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for each client (>90%)
- [ ] Clear documentation and migration guide
- [ ] Performance equivalent or better than current implementation
- [ ] No breaking changes for existing users

# üîç **BOUNDARY INTERFACE ANALYSIS REPORT**

## **Executive Summary**
Comprehensive analysis completed using parallel subagents. While the refactor successfully maintains **100% backward compatibility** for public APIs, there are **critical interface mismatches** between internal layers that will cause runtime failures. The architecture is sound, but needs interface alignment fixes.

---

## **üö® Critical Issues Found**

### **1. Container ‚Üî Client Boundary (15 Critical Mismatches)**

#### **Most Critical Runtime Breaking Issues:**

**HTTP Method Mismatches** - Clients send POST, containers expect DELETE:
- `killProcess()`: Client POST (`process-client.ts:155`) vs Container DELETE (`index.ts:293`)
- `killAllProcesses()`: Client POST (`process-client.ts:173`) vs Container DELETE (`index.ts:278`)  
- `unexposePort()`: Client POST (`port-client.ts:97`) vs Container DELETE (`index.ts:254`)

**Wrong API Endpoints**:
- Client calls `/api/execute-stream` (`command-client.ts:96`), container serves `/api/execute/stream` (`index.ts:150-154`)

**Missing Response Fields**:
- Port operations: Container returns `exposedAt` (`ports.ts:48-62`), client expects `url` (`port-client.ts:15-19`)
- Utility operations: Container missing `success`/`count` fields in ping/commands responses

**Request Structure Mismatches**:
- File rename: Client sends `path` (`file-client.ts:182`), container expects `oldPath` (`types.ts:78-82`)
- File move: Client sends `path`/`newPath` (`file-client.ts:203`), container expects `sourcePath`/`destinationPath` (`types.ts:84-88`)

### **2. Client ‚Üî Sandbox Boundary (6 Issues)**

**Key Problems**:
- **Type Import Issues**: Direct imports instead of type imports in `sandbox.ts:236`
- **Missing Session Support**: Port/file operations don't pass `sessionId` parameters (`sandbox.ts:493,517`)
- **Brittle Error Handling**: String-based error detection instead of structured responses (`sandbox.ts:382-384`)
- **Type Assertions Without Validation**: `status: process.status as ProcessStatus` (`sandbox.ts:267,322`)
- **Response Mapping Issues**: `getExposedPorts` assumes wrong field structure (`sandbox.ts:524-538`)

### **3. Type Consistency (4 Critical Type Issues)**

**Major Problems**:
- **Circular Import Dependency**: `clients/types.ts:1` imports from `../index`
- **Duplicate Type Definitions**: `ExecEvent` and `LogEvent` defined differently in multiple files
  - `ExecEvent`: Main types has required `timestamp`, client version has optional
  - `LogEvent`: Client version missing `processId` and has wrong field optionality
- **ProcessStatus Inconsistency**: Client `ProcessInfo.status` missing `'starting'` and `'error'` status values
- **Missing Type Exports**: Client response types not exported from main index

---

## **‚úÖ What's Working Well**

### **Public API Boundary: 100% Backward Compatible**
- All original `ISandbox` methods preserved with identical signatures
- Method return types unchanged - existing user code works without modification
- Example projects (`examples/basic/`) work without any code changes
- Error types and classes maintained (`SandboxError`, `ProcessNotFoundError`, etc.)

### **Architecture Quality**
- Clean domain separation (Command, File, Process, Port, Git, Utility)
- Proper BaseHttpClient abstraction with shared HTTP logic
- Professional SDK patterns following AWS/Google Cloud structure
- Security validation preserved across all layers

---

## **üéØ Critical Fix Priority**

### **Priority 1: Runtime Breaking Issues** üî•
1. **Fix HTTP method mismatches** - Update clients to use correct HTTP methods (DELETE vs POST)
2. **Fix API endpoint paths** - Align streaming endpoint path (`/api/execute-stream` vs `/api/execute/stream`)
3. **Fix missing response fields** - Add URL generation in port operations, missing success fields

### **Priority 2: Type Safety Issues** ‚ö†Ô∏è  
4. **Resolve circular import dependency** - Fix `clients/types.ts` importing from `../index`
5. **Consolidate duplicate type definitions** - Use single source of truth for `ExecEvent`/`LogEvent`
6. **Add proper type validation** - Replace type assertions with runtime validation

### **Priority 3: Enhancement Issues** üìà
7. **Add session support** - Enable session parameters in port/file operations
8. **Export missing client response types** - Add all client types to main index exports
9. **Improve error handling** - Use structured error responses instead of string matching

---

## **üîß Action Items for Fixes**

### **Immediate Actions Required:**
- [x] **Update HTTP methods** in ProcessClient and PortClient to match container expectations
- [x] **Fix streaming endpoint path** in CommandClient 
- [x] **Add URL generation logic** for port operations response
- [x] **Fix file operation request field names** (rename/move operations)
- [x] **Consolidate event type definitions** to eliminate duplicates
- [x] **Remove circular imports** in type system

### **Next Steps:**
- [ ] **Add runtime type validation** before type assertions
- [ ] **Export missing response types** from main index
- [ ] **Add session parameter support** to port/file operations
- [ ] **Implement structured error responses** with proper error codes

---

## **Overall Assessment**

**Architecture Grade: A-** 
- Excellent design principles and backward compatibility preservation
- Well-organized domain separation following industry best practices
- Professional SDK patterns implemented correctly

**Implementation Grade: C+**
- Critical runtime interface mismatches present that need immediate fixes
- Type consistency issues across layers
- Some features incomplete (session support, proper error handling)

**Recommendation**: The refactor is **architecturally sound** and maintains perfect backward compatibility, but requires **interface alignment fixes** before production deployment. The issues are well-defined and fixable without architectural changes.
