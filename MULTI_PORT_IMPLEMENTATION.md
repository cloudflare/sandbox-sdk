# Multi-Port Support Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Sandbox Class (`packages/sandbox/src/sandbox.ts`)
- Removed hardcoded `defaultPort = 3000`
- Added custom `fetch()` method that determines which port to route to
- Added `determinePort()` method that:
  - Extracts port from `/proxy/{port}/*` requests
  - Routes all other requests to control plane on port 3000

### 2. Request Handler (`packages/sandbox/src/request-handler.ts`)
- Updated to route directly to target ports instead of proxying through port 3000
- Logic: If port !== 3000, route directly to user's service on that port
- Control plane requests (port 3000) are routed normally

### 3. Example Code (`examples/basic/src/index.ts`)
- Added `/test-multi-port` endpoint demonstrating:
  - Running an API server on port 3001
  - Running a web server on port 8080
  - Both services accessible via their own preview URLs

### 4. Container Server (`packages/sandbox/container_src/index.ts`)
- Fixed TypeScript issue by adding `websocket: undefined` to serve config
- Control plane continues to run on port 3000

## How It Works

1. **Port-based routing**: The port number in the preview URL determines where to route
2. **Port 3000 is special**: Reserved for the control plane (SDK's built-in server)
3. **Direct routing**: User services on other ports receive requests directly
4. **No endpoint lists**: Clean separation without maintaining hardcoded endpoint lists

## Testing

The implementation has been tested for TypeScript compatibility and follows the plan outlined in PORT_PLAN.md. The multi-port architecture now allows users to run services on arbitrary ports without conflicts with the control plane.
