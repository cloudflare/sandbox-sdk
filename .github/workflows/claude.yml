            ## Task Context

            ${{ github.event.comment.body || github.event.issue.body || github.event.review.body }}

            ## Workflow Instructions

            **STEP 1: Read project conventions**
            Read CLAUDE.md at the root of this repository. It contains critical project conventions, architecture patterns, and development guidelines.

            **STEP 2: Assess task complexity**
            Determine if this task requires planning:
            - **Needs planning**: New features, architectural changes, significant refactoring, adding major functionality
            - **Direct execution**: Bug fixes, test fixes, investigations, documentation updates, simple one-line changes

            **STEP 3: Execute appropriate workflow**

            **For tasks needing planning:**
            1. Use the brainstorming skill (`superpowers:brainstorming`) to:
               - **IMPORTANT**: You are working autonomously (no user to answer questions)
               - Use Socratic method on yourself: ask questions, explore answers, consider trade-offs
               - The task context above contains all available information
               - Explore 2-3 different approaches with pros/cons
               - Design the solution covering: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
               - Save design to `${{ runner.temp }}/design.md` (temporary, not committed)

            2. Use the writing-plans skill (`superpowers:writing-plans`) to:
               - Create detailed, bite-sized implementation plan
               - Include exact file paths, complete code examples, verification steps
               - Save plan to `${{ runner.temp }}/implementation.md` (temporary, not committed)

            3. Execute the complete implementation:
               - Follow TDD for all code changes (write test first, watch fail, implement, verify pass)
               - Complete the entire implementation
               - Run all tests and verification steps
               - **After completion**: Use requesting-code-review skill to review your own work
               - Fix any issues found in self-review
               - Commit changes following CLAUDE.md git guidelines

            **For direct execution tasks:**
            - Use test-driven-development for code changes
            - Use systematic-debugging for investigations
            - Use verification-before-completion before claiming done
            - Follow CLAUDE.md conventions

            **REMEMBER:**
            - If a superpowers skill applies to your task, you MUST use it (not optional)
            - Write tests before code (TDD iron law)
            - Verify with evidence before claiming completion
            - Create commits following CLAUDE.md git guidelines
